## Description

A port of [sm64coopdx](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx) to iOS

## TODOS 
 - [X] Compile
 - [X] Fix touch controls
 - [x] Compile libjuice for iOS
 - [x] Try to understand the code
 - [ ] Compile coopnet for iOS
 - [ ] Replace touch controls with better textures from robertkirkman/sm64ex-coop
 - [ ] Add ex-coop buttons to touch controls
 - [ ] Disable building for PC
 - [ ] Remove simulatedStartFlag
 - [ ] Add gamepad support
 - [ ] Delete support for tvOS
 - [ ] Create a compilation tutorial
 - [ ] Make first release
 - [ ] Add ability to change touch control buttons size and position

Contains code from:
 - VDavid003/sm64-port-android
 - ckosmic/sm64ex-ios
 - robertkirkman/sm64ex-coop (textures, in near future)
 - and coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx of course

code is not good because it's WIP

Most of the Objective C files are ai generated because i just don't understand and don't want to learn ObjC

## TVOS IS NOT SUPPORTED AT ALL! DO NOT TRY TO BUILD IT! I WILL FULLY DELETE SUPPORT IN NEXT UPDATES
